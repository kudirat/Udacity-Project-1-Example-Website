## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to utilize HTML and CSS to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure my files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style. This project includes the main blog website along with individual blog post sites linked to it.

## Takeaways
This project gave me the creative freedom to experiment with layout tools such as CSS Grid and Flexbox to create unique layouts and web page designs. I was also able to work with Google Chrome Developer tools to implement responsive web design and ensure that my blog site was accessible and functional on different devices.
