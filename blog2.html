            <p id="pone">What makes <em>Kotaro Lives Alone</em> so great for me personally is the maturity of the main character, Kotaro. Despite being so young, extremely in fact compared to his fellow tenants, he offers them sometimes the most profound advice an adult could ask for.</p>

            <img src="images/kotaro3.webp" alt="Kotaro image" id="picthree">
            <p id ="ptwo"> However despite his maturity, the show is quick to remind us that Kotaro is still a child that needs to be taken care of. We see this when he begins going through hurdles-such as attending his school's opening ceremony by himself. One where children are usually occumpanied by their guardians. His fellow tenants however fill up that void making up for the sadness!</p>
            <p id ="pthree"> There's so many wholesome moments between Kotaro and his neighbors and it really puts a smile on my face seeing them all pitch in their own ways to raise him. And he, raise them...in a sense. But, this show really brings meaning to the phrase- "it takes a village to raise a child"</p>
