    <p>Hello! Welcome to my Shows Recommendations blog! Here I'll be covering a few shows that I've been watching that I'd recommend others to try too! </p>

            <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Spy X Family Anime Spring 2022</figcaption>
            <a href = "blog1.html">SpyxFamily</a>
            <p>A Slice of Life Comedy about a spy, telepath, and assasin, and how they form a fake family for the sake of world peace! This characters are highly entertaining and the art is very eye-catching!</p>
       
    </div>
    <div class = "card" id = "two">
            <img src="images/kotaro.jpg" alt="Spy x Family image">
            <figcaption>Fig. 2 - Kotaro Lives Alone Anime Spring 2022</figcaption>
            <a href = "blog2.html">Kotaro Lives Alone</a>
            <p>A Slice of Life Comedy that sometimes reminds you that it's a little tragic (that's sugar-coating at this point). The main character, Kotaro, despite his back story being really heart-breaking, is a great role-model when it comes to perserverance.</p>

            <figcaption>Fig. 3 - Jojo's Bizarre Adventures Ongoing</figcaption>
            <a href = "blog3.html">Jojo's Bizarre Adventures</a>
            <p>If you're looking for a plot that'll have you walking in circles in confusion and entertainment, I'd definitely recommend Jojo's Bizarre Adventures. Despite the beginning which is slow, but without a doubt necessary, this show will have you practicing the most absurd back-bending poses in your bathroom mirror. </p>
